## About Me

**Data Scientist & AI/ML Engineer** turning complex problems into practical solutions for years.

I’ve spent my career helping businesses actually *use* data, moving past buzzwords to deliver real, measurable impact. My background spans Computer Science, Statistics and even Biomedical Engineering, but I've always focused on translating complexity into strategy that works.

I’m also a lifelong nerd for linguistics, psychology, history, and all subjects with patterns. This simply fascinates me and that’s why I ended up in optimization and AI: always looking for the best path through complexity.

And yes—I’m a die-hard sci-fi nerd, gamer and cinephile. Star Wars, Cyberpunk 2077, TRON, Blade Runner, The Matrix… all part of why I wanted to work on building systems that feel like magic but are rooted in good ol’ fashioned math.
